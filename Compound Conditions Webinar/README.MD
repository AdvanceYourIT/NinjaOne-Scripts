Thank you to all who attended the Compound Conditions webinar, which you can find on YouTube [here]{https://youtu.be/y7WvImYobJ0}

## First Example: Software Deployment with Compound Conditions

The first example revolved around software deployment by utilizing a compound condition to check for the absence of software (Google Chrome in this case), while also looking for the text string **"Google Chrome"** in a custom field.

To update more easily, you can leverage an automated documentation server or API server to bulk update and append to custom fields.

### Steps:
- **Read more about setting up an API server here:** [NinjaOne API Setup](https://docs.mspp.io/ninjaone/getting-started)
- **Set up a multi-line custom field** with 'Organization' scope, with Read/Write capabilities for the API and Read-Only for automations.
  - Whether you want technicians to be able to modify this field is up to youâ€”otherwise, only system administrators would be able to update, remove, and add software for deployment using the API server method.
  - If technicians can modify this, it's recommended to regularly back up the list of applications to be installed via API.
- **Set up a second multi-line custom field** with 'Device' scope so that applications can be specified per device.

### Script for Updating Deployed Software
Access the script to update deployed software here, and import it into NinjaOne.

#### Required Script Variables:
| Name | Pretty Name | Script Variable Type |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| `appendToOrganizations` | Append To Organizations | String/Text |
| `softwareToAppend` | Software To Append | String/Text |
| `removeFromOrganizations` | Remove From Organizations | String/Text |
| `softwareToRemove` | Software To Remove | String/Text |
| `appendToDevices` | Append To Devices | String/Text |
| `deviceSoftwareToAppend` | Device Software To Append | String/Text |
| `removeFromDevices` | Remove From Devices | String/Text |
| `deviceSoftwareToRemove` | Device Software To Remove | String/Text |

You can now use the API server and the `Update-SoftwareDeployment` script to start creating a comma-separated list of applications that should be installed for an organization. Then, create a **compound condition** looking for:
1. The absence of that software.
2. The text string identifying your application that is found in your custom field(s).

## Second Example: Authorized Applications Tracking

The second example was an **inversion of the first**â€”instead of setting up applications for deployment, this approach establishes a **list of authorized applications** in an organization scope and/or device scope WYSIWYG custom field.

ðŸ“Œ **Full documentation and scripts for this workflow:**  
[GitHub - NinjaOne Application Tracking](https://github.com/jeffhunterninja/NinjaOne-Scripts/tree/main/Application%20Tracking)

### Workflow Overview:
- **`Check-AuthorizedApplications`** runs as a **script result condition** as part of a compound condition.
  - A **custom field condition** (e.g., a checkbox) can be used as an enablement switch if you donâ€™t want these checks to apply to all organizations.
- **`Update-AuthorizedApplications`** runs on your API server and is used to:
  - Update, remove, or append application names to a **comma-separated string** stored in a WYSIWYG field at either the organization or device level.
- **`Recover-AuthorizedApplications`** backs up your stored comma-separated string with an **option to restore** if necessary.
- **`Report-UnauthorizedApplications`** retrieves all currently reported unauthorized applications for:
  - A **global view** of unauthorized applications.
  - Easier **whitelisting at scale**.

## Third Example: Using NinjaOne Documentation for Device Configuration

The third example utilized **NinjaOne Documentation** to create a document with **custom field checkboxes** that indicate whether certain device configurations should be enabled or not.

### Process:
1. **Custom Field Checkboxes**  
   - A document is created in **NinjaOne Documentation** with checkboxes that specify if certain device configurations should be enabled (e.g., "Enable Firewall").
   
2. **Script Result Condition (Check Configuration Intent)**  
   - A **script result condition** is used as part of a **compound condition** to check if the checkbox is marked in the documentation.

3. **Script Result Condition (Verify Device State)**  
   - A second **script result condition** evaluates the actual **state of the device**.
   - For example, if the **Device Configuration** document has the checkbox marked for **"Enable Firewall"**, the template library script **"Audit Firewall Status"** is used to confirm whether the firewall is actually enabled on the device.
